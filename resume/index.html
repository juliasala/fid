<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>My name is Julia Salamone, and I am an aspiring graphic designer. I am excited to learn more about the profession, and hope to get opportunities within the field to gain experience and to help further my knowledge. I am currently majoring in Digital Media/Graphic Design (A.S.), and will earn related certificates along the way. While becoming a graphic designer is my dream, I have a love for other creative digital outlets, such as advertising on social media. Although I currently have limited experience, I am determined to learn. I will make a great addition to a creative team environment as I am a quick learner, and look forward to start working at what I have wanted to do for so long.
